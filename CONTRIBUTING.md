## Guidelines

### Formatting

```markdown
- [Name](Link)
```

- Use [title casing](http://titlecapitalization.com).
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

### Making a Pull Request

- The pull request should have a useful title, like `Add [name of change]` instead of `Update README`
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion
